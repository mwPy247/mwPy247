- 👋 Hi, I’m Moritz Wolff
- 👀 I’m currently interested most in working with Python and SQL.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled as student of computer science in Leipzig, Germany, where I learn a lot about these interests and related fields. I will start a masters program in Data Science from october 2021 onwards. Besides studying, I'm working as a working student data analyst for an online-marketing agency in Leipzig.
- 💞️ If you think any of my interests or projects look promising for collaboration, I would be happy to hear from you.
